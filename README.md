# AP-FRQs-2025

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on [Date]. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.
If a student from this class in the future is he start praying as you in for a rough time
## Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- My preparation strategy for the exam included...
  - drinking a can of celsius   
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were...
  - the FRQs as they had 5 trillion words you needed to read and was overwelming
- Time management techniques that worked well for me...
  - no idea just do it fast
  - do the questions you know and mark the ones you dont
  - go back and do the marked ones and pray
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions...
  - just panic and pray

## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Topic/Concept 1: class initalization
- Topic/Concept 2: always 2d arrays you need them 500%
- Programming practice: everything and boolian expresions as it gets confusing quick

## Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

im a moron and didnt use any **Don't be me you will get a 0 and not even a 1**

## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:
  give up on this language and go back to python unless i get to make minecraft mods
